ADO.NET, Entity Framework

Application (doesn’t matter what kind of, console app will be quite enough), which goes to the database and performs CRUD operations with the data.
DAL should be implemented using ADO.NET (1st variant) and Entity Framework (the approach doesn’t matter, but I should advice to use the one you don’t have experience in working with).
So there should be TWO DALs, and the application should be configured to be able to easy switch between them, so the application would work the same.
Think about at least 2 layer architecture.

Approximate topic: you have students, faculties, universities. Each student has some score and Subjects which he studies in the current semester.
Get all the students from selected university.
Get the average score for each student and find the best student in the group.
Update student’s subject list.
Delete some student if he was removed from university.
Etc.
